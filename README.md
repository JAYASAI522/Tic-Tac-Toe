# Tic-Tac-Toe


🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe in Java
It is a simple and fun two-player command-line game built using core Java concepts. Players take turns entering row and column positions (0-based index) to place their marks (❌ or ⭕) on a 3x3 grid. 

The game checks for winning conditions across rows, columns, and diagonals after each move and declares a winner or a draw when the board is full. To play, 
just clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/JAVA-TicTacToe.git`, 

compile with `javac TicTacToe.java`, and run using `java TicTacToe`. 

This project is great for beginners to practice loops, conditionals, arrays, and user input handling in Java. It's easy to understand, modify, and expand—perfect for learning or casual coding fun! 🚀✨
